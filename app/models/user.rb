  # has_many: This is a Rails association method that sets up a one-to-many relationship
  # :active_relationships: This is a symbolic name for this association. Itâ€™s used in the code to refer to this specific relationship.
  # class_name: "Follower": This specifies that the association is related to the Follower model.
  # foreign_key: :"follower_id": This tells Rails which column in the followers table should be used to link to the User model. In this case, follower_id refers to the ID of the user who is following someone else.
  # dependent: :destroy: This option indicates that when a user is deleted, any associated Follower records where the user is the follower will also be deleted.
